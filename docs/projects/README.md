## Projects

<ProjectCard image="/projects/1.png">

  Harry P., Hermione G., *et al*
  
  **The Making of Hsieh's Wand**
  
  Harry's wand was broken in 1997, but was repaired by him after the 1998 Battle of Hogwarts. Usually the repair of a wand is impossible, but with the use of the Elder Wand it was achievable.
